# AAindex.jl

A package to read [AAindex](https://www.genome.jp/aaindex/) database files.
These contain a variety of reported physico-chemical and biochemical
properties of amino acids (Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000). The package now
also provides a copy of the database files (v9.2) for convenience. However,
you may still use your own copy if you want to.

## Usage

The main interface provided by this package is the `search` function, which
accepts a search term (_e.g._, `ANDN920101` or `hydrophobicity`) and,
optionally, a path to an AAindex database file. It will search through the
database and return a list of matching database entries. Additionally, the
`aaindex_by_id` function provides a more direct interface for loading a specific
entry.

```julia-repl
julia> search("hydrophobicity")
search("hydrophobicity")

julia> index = aaindex_by_id("JURD980101")
Index(Union{Nothing, Float64}[1.1, -5.1, -3.5, -3.6, 2.5, -3.68, -3.2, -0.64, -3.2, 4.5, 3.8, -4.11, 1.9, 2.8, -1.9, -0.5, -0.7, -0.46, -1.3, 4.2], Dict{String, AbstractFloat}("BASU050103" => Float16(0.871), "JANJ790101" => Float16(0.868), "PONP800101" => Float16(0.858), "CORJ870107" => Float16(0.804), "MIYS990104" => Float16(-0.813), "KANM800104" => Float16(0.826), "FASG890101" => Float16(-0.857), "CORJ870101" => Float16(0.849), "NADH010101" => Float16(0.925), "JANJ780102" => Float16(0.928)â€¦), Metadata("JURD980101", "Modified Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale (Juretic et al., 1998)", [""], "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, 5, 405-445 (1998)", "Protein transmembrane structure: recognition and prediction by using   hydrophobicity scales through preference functions", "Juretic, D., Lucic, B., Zucic, D. and Trinajstic, N.", ""))
```

This returns an array of `Index` and `AMatrix` objects with the following
respective interfaces:

```julia-repl
struct Index <: AbstractAAIndex
    data::SVector{20}
    correlation::Dict{String, AbstractFloat}
    metadata::Metadata
end

struct AMatrix <: AbstractAAIndex
    rowids::String
    columnids::String
    data::Union{SHermitianCompact, SMatrix}
    metadata::Metadata
end
```

Entry metadata is stored in a separate struct with the following interface:

```julia-repl
struct Metadata
    id::String
    description::String
    reference::Array{String}
    journal::String
    title::String
    authors::String
    comment::String
end
```

Amino acid sequences can be transformed into vectors of values from an index
using the `transform` function.

```julia-repl
julia> transform(index, "ARN")
3-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.1
 -5.1
 -3.5
```

You can use the `transform` function to calculate the average value of an index
over a sequence.

```julia-repl
julia> using Statistics

julia> transform(index, ["Ala", "Arg", "Asn"]) |> mean
-2.5
```

You can also define your own functions to calculate properties of a sequence. For example, here is a function that calculates the GRAVY (Grand Average of Hydropathy) metric of a sequence.

```julia-repl
julia> function gravy(sequence)
    # use the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index
    index = aaindex_by_id("KYTJ820101")
    hydropathies = transform(index, sequence)

    sum(hydropathies) / length(sequence)
end

julia> gravy("LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES")
-0.7243243243243245
```
